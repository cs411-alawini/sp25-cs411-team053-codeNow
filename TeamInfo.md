## Project Summary

Career Compass is a job market insights platform designed to help job seekers, students, and professionals make informed career decisions using real-time data. It aggregates job postings from platforms like Glassdoor and labor statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to offer users valuable insights into salary trends, hiring demands, and industry growth.
Users can explore job opportunities based on location, industry, and salary, while also gaining a better understanding of in-demand skills and workforce trends. The platform provides salary comparisons across different roles and regions, enabling users to set realistic career expectations.
Through search filters and interactive visualizations, Career Compass simplifies job market research and allows users to stay updated on industry shifts. Employers and recruiters can also utilize the platform to track hiring trends and refine their recruitment strategies based on current market data.
