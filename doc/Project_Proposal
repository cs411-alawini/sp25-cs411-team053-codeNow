Description

Career Compass is a web-based application designed to provide users with comprehensive insights into the job market. The platform aims to bridge the information gap between job seekers and the labor market by consolidating data from multiple sources into a single, accessible interface. The application will collect real-time job postings from platforms like Glassdoor and combine this with employment statistics and salary data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This integrated approach allows users to gain a detailed understanding of hiring demand, salary expectations, and industry growth trends.
Career Compass is not just a job boardâ€”it is a data-driven career exploration tool. Users can search and compare jobs based on industry, location, and salary while also accessing visual insights into workforce trends. By offering up-to-date labor market information alongside interactive tools, the platform helps users make informed career decisions and better navigate their professional journeys.




Creative Component
To enhance the user experience and provide deeper insights, Career Compass will integrate interactive data visualizations and trend prediction analytics as a creative component. Using libraries like D3.js, Plotly, or Chart.js, the platform will display salary distributions, job availability heatmaps, and industry growth patterns in an intuitive, visual format.
Additionally, the system will leverage machine learning techniques (e.g., linear regression or time series analysis) to forecast future job market trends based on historical data. This predictive analysis will help users anticipate which industries and roles are likely to grow, giving them a competitive edge in career planning.
These features go beyond basic data display by offering dynamic visual tools and data-driven forecasts, improving the platform's usability and making complex labor data accessible and actionable.
